# cstidham_CastleQuest
Final game assignment for CS120

Project goals – Create a functional game capable of saving and loading that combines how long the player stays alive and how much gold they collect into their score. 
Instructions – Use the arrow keys to move around the area. Dodge the incoming debris and arrows while collecting as many coins as possible before you die.
Technologies and techniques – random, simpleGE, pygame, json

Process:
-	What was learned – Sprite animation/ cycles, game states/ transitions, simpleGE and pygame
-	Where I got stuck – Trying to dictate high score with both time and gold elements, improving collision, setting screen bounds, making sure save/load system properly saves/ loads high score 
-	What to improve – Collision, Gold spawn/ delay, end screen/ animation/ transition, change art design so all assets don’t feel random
-	What I would’ve done differently – Health from numbers to hearts, added collectable powerups, made all assets myself
-	How I kept from straying from original design – Constantly referring to original design mockup, getting assets before coding, creating a base environment to test new features and find bugs 
-	How I kept on track – Section out each feature/ section as achievable goals based on perceived difficulty, “due dates” for each section, podcasts for background noise (helps make progress not feel as long
